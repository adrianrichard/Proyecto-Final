Aliases Example
==========================

As part of our broader range of the rml language, this example should demonstrate how to work with aliases

Look at the output pdf. Try tweaking the rml and regenerating the file to see your changes in action!


Run the example
==========================

1. Make an account on the [website](https://www.reportlab.com/accounts/register/) (needed for step 4)
2. Create a virtual environment (e.g. `python3.12 -m venv .`)
3. Activate the virtual environment (`. bin/activate`)
4. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and use your username from step 1.
5. Run `rml2pdf alises_substack.rml`

The file should then be generated as `aliases_substack.pdf`
