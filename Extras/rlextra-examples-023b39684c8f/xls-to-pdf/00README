Code Walk Through

Take a look at the directory structure:

data/ 
output/
rml/
runme.py.py
investor_company_sectors_pie.py
product_chart.py
utils.py

rml/ will hold the fonts, images, and templates for constructing the documents.

output/ will hold the generated PDFs.

rml/template.prep is where we use RML to define the PDF structure and content.
